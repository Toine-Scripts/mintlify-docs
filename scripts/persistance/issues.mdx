## Common Issues

### Vehicles are locked unexpectedly
This issue is typically caused by external scripts that manage vehicle locking (such as key systems or NPC traffic scripts) which automatically lock vehicles upon spawning.

#### Example: qb-vehiclekeys
By default, `qb-vehiclekeys` locks all vehicles that are not owned by the player. To ensure compatibility, update your configuration as follows:

```lua qb-vehiclekeys/config.lua
Config.LockNPCParkedCars = false
Config.LockNPCDrivingCars = false
```

## Performance & Optimization

### Database (DB) Performance Issues

If you are experiencing database performance issues, you can disable the real-time DB sync in your configuration.

```lua config.lua
Config.Server.realTimeDBSync = false
```

<Warning>
**Trade-off Analysis:**

*   **Enabled (true):** Maximum data safety. In case of a server crash, no data is lost.
*   **Disabled (false):** Better performance and lower resource usage. Recommended for servers with high player counts. You will only lose data up to your last auto-save interval if a crash occurs.
</Warning>

<Card title="✋ Toine's personal advice">
  My personal advice is to **disable** the real-time DB sync at any player count. It can significantly impact performance, and the risk of data loss is minimal with the auto-save interval.

## Upcoming Fixes

I am currently developing a standalone, lightweight script to handle vehicle locking specifically at spawn. It will be released for free very soon.
