The script features a plugin system that allows you to extend its functionality. Plugins are located in the `bridge/plugins` folder and can be easily enabled or disabled via the configuration file.

## How to enable a plugin

To enable a plugin, you simply need to set its corresponding configuration value to `true` in `shared/config.lua`.

```lua shared/config.lua
Config.Bridge = {
    VehicleDeformation = true,
    -- Add other plugins here
}
```
