This plugin allows you to sync vehicle deformation using the [VehicleDeformation](https://github.com/Kiminaze/VehicleDeformation) resource.

> All credits for the deformation logic go to [Kiminaze](https://github.com/Kiminaze). We simply provide a bridge to use it with our persistence system.

## Requirements

- [VehicleDeformation](https://github.com/Kiminaze/VehicleDeformation) by Kiminaze

## Configuration

To enable this plugin, set `Config.Bridge.VehicleDeformation` to `true` in `shared/config.lua`.

```lua shared/config.lua
Config.Bridge.VehicleDeformation = true
```

## How it works

When enabled, the script will use the `GetVehicleDeformation` export from `VehicleDeformation` to save the deformation data of the vehicle.
This data is then applied when the vehicle is spawned.


## Disclaimer

This script does not contain any code from the original resource, it only uses the exports provided by it, respecting the original license.
